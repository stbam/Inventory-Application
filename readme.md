This project will be pokemon themed.
1.PokeApi will be used for creating new pokemon
2.Will probably be styled in the shape of a pokedex.
3.buttons will allow you to interact with the screen

general idea: I want to create a pokedex where you can see the pokemon on the screen

technical idea:
X 1. have the api url hidden and let user input the name of pokemon. Then they can add it to their pokedex in another
page
2.maybe implement a sorting and/or scroll(for search like slide show kinda thing)?
3.implement a login with every user having the ability to have their own separate collection of pokemons
4. suppose user doesnt know any pokemon implement a scroll/random function for them to find some 
Pages so far:
1.search pokemon
2.Pokedex (with scroll function?)
3.a signle display for each pokemon in colletion where you can update it
