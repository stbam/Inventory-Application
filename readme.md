This project will be pokemon themed.
1.PokeApi will be used for creating new pokemon
2.Will probably be styled in the shape of a pokedex.
3.buttons will allow you to interact with the screen

general idea: I want to create a pokedex where you can see the pokemon on the screen

technical idea:
1. have the api url hidden and let user input the name of pokemon. Then they can add it to their pokedex in another
page


Pages so far:
1.search pokemon
2.Pokedex (with scroll function?)
3.
